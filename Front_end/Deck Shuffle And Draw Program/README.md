# Deck Shuffle and Draw Program

This is a front-end program for shuffling a deck and drawing a specific amount of cards. 

## Manual

- Step 1: Pull the whole files from the registry.
- Step 2: Open the HTML file under the "Deck Shuffle and Draw Program" folder.
- Step 3: Enjoy the game!

## Explanation

- **Shuffle Button**: Click the button to shuffle the cards into a random order.
- **Draw Input**: Enter the amount of cards to draw. It must be a number greater than 0 and less than the remaining number of cards in the deck.
- **Draw Button**: Click the button to draw the number of cards entered in the draw input.
- **Reset Button**: Reset everything and replay.

## Possible Improvements

- Build a player system to determine the number of players and the amount of cards they draw. Validation may be needed to ensure there are enough cards for all players.
- Create a UDP connection to make a live game. Different IP addresses will represent different players. Each player can see their own cards, and other players can see which cards have been drawn but not who drew them. Players can also play cards, and all players can see the played cards.
